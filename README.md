# Background
AtliQ Hardware is a leading provider of electronic hardware, supplying a wide range of products such as PCs, keyboards, and mice. The company operates through multiple sales channels, including e-commerce platforms (like Amazon and Flipkart) and traditional brick-and-mortar retail stores. To support its growth objectives, AtliQ Hardware undertakes a variety of internal projects aimed at improving business operations, expanding its market reach, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

# Project Overview
The "Project Priority Matrix" evaluates various ongoing or potential internal projects at AtliQ Hardware across three key dimensions: Feasibility, Impact, and Size. These criteria help prioritize projects based on their strategic alignment, resource requirements, and expected business outcomes.

The projects considered in this report include:

- Project Mojo - Focused on streamlining internal processes.
- AU Expansion - Aiming to expand AtliQ Hardware's market presence in Australia.
- DB Integration - Integration of databases across systems to enhance data access.
- Employee Index - Developing an index to assess and improve employee satisfaction.
- Project 777 - A confidential, high-impact project.
- Project 10 - A specialized initiative with potential growth implications.
- D - An operational project focused on daily business efficiency.
- Project WK - Involves product development and innovation.

# Priority Matrix Analysis
Each project is assessed based on the following criteria:
- **Feasibility**: How easily the project can be executed, taking into account available resources, technical complexity, and organizational readiness.
- **Impact**: The potential business value generated by the project, such as revenue growth, cost savings, or customer satisfaction.
- **Size**: The scale of the project, in terms of time, budget, and workforce required.

# Key Findings
- **High-Priority Projects**
  - Project Mojo: With a high feasibility score of 7 and an impact score of 8, this project is expected to streamline AtliQ Hardware’s internal processes efficiently. Its high size score of 10 also indicates that it will require considerable resources but has a large-scale impact.
  - AU Expansion: This project has the highest feasibility score (9), indicating strong alignment with AtliQ’s growth strategy. Though it has a lower impact score (4), its size (2) suggests it is a relatively low-resource initiative, making it an attractive option for the company.

- **Medium-Priority Projects**
  - DB Integration: Scoring moderately across feasibility (5), impact (4), and size (3), this project aims to consolidate databases across systems. Though it presents challenges in execution, it could significantly improve AtliQ’s data capabilities.
  - Employee Index: With an impact score of 6 and a feasibility of 7, this project focuses on boosting employee satisfaction and retention. Given its moderate resource requirements (size score of 4), it represents a balanced, strategic initiative.

- **Low-Priority Projects**
  - Project WK: Scoring high in feasibility (8), this project focuses on daily operations and product innovation. However, its size (1) and moderate impact (7) place it in the low-priority category for now.
  - Project 777 and Project 10: Both are lower on the feasibility scale, but Project 777 stands out for its high impact score (7). Given its high resource requirements (size 6), it may be a future candidate for consideration once higher-priority projects are underway.
  
# Recommendations
- Focus on High-Feasibility, High-Impact Projects: AtliQ Hardware should prioritize Project Mojo and AU Expansion to streamline internal processes and support its market growth objectives. Both projects are achievable with moderate resources and can deliver substantial business benefits.
- Monitor Medium-Priority Initiatives: Projects like DB Integration and Employee Index should be monitored for potential execution as resources free up. These initiatives can improve internal operations and employee engagement, contributing to long-term success.
- Consider Deprioritizing or Postponing Low-Impact Projects: While some projects, such as Project WK and Project 10, present operational or innovation benefits, they may not align with immediate business goals and could be deprioritized or delayed.
